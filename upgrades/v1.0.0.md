# Kroma v1.0.0 Upgrade Instructions

This document provides instructions to upgrade from Kroma v0.3.0 to v1.0.0.

## Guides for upgrade

### Stop Kroma

For upgrade, stop your Kroma full node or validator.
```bash
# for full node
docker compose --profile fullnode down

# for validator
docker compose --profile validator down
```

### Common

You need to update your `.env` file.

First, update the tag of `kroma-node` and `kroma-validator` docker image.
```
IMAGE_TAG__KROMA_NODE=v1.0.0
IMAGE_TAG__KROMA_VALIDATOR=v1.0.0
```

### Validator

For validator, a new flag is added.

#### Added

- `KROMA_VALIDATOR__ALLOW_PUBLIC_ROUND` is added. If you want to submit an output in public round,
  set `KROMA_VALIDATOR__ALLOW_PUBLIC_ROUND=true`. In public round, only the fastest validator can submit an output,
  so the other transaction will fail, and it will cost additional gas fee.

### Start Kroma

You can now start Kroma full node or validator with a new version.

```bash
# for full node
docker compose --profile fullnode up -d

# for validator
docker compose --profile validator up -d
```
